# SciFi UI Project

# Description of the assignment

As part of Object Oriented Programming assignment we were required to create a Scifi inspired UI using Java and Processing.
The aim of the assignment was not only to test our ability of creative coding but also the knowledge of using OOP concepts 
such as polymorphism, abstraction or inheritance.
We could take an inspiration from any of the SciFi movies that we have watched or heard about.
When I was thinking about how I want my UI to look like, the first thing that came to my mind was the interface in Iron Man suit.
Whenever Tony Stark is using his Iron Man suit, he can see all the important information right under the mask.
That is where I decided to take my inspiration from first.
After few days working on the design and starting to implement it, I realized that my idea was a little bit too ambitious.
My second idea was a'computer screen' like interface, with folder icons, a terminal you could code in and so on.
After working on it for a day or 2 I changed my mind again... 
I am not a Sci-Fi fan, so I didn't know what to do, and if whatever I am doing looks any close to what people uderstands as Science Fiction.
I finally decided to design something like an inside of a space ship, to be honest I am not completly sure what it is, but I am not an alien after all!  

# Instructions

Imagine yourself escaping Earth, everyone is dead, you can no longer live there. You are getting an opportunity to escape to space in this amazing space ship.
The program behind it calls you as per 'master', you can control everything with only few buttons, if you spend there a while probably the voice recognition will kick in.
When starting the program you can see entire program straight away, on the left hand side there are super colorful flashing buttons, some interesting bars on the left, entire 
space is in front of you, and look at those stars. Some of the buttons do not work and the spaceship is still a little bit shy.
I was considering adding an option to shoot to the rockets visible on the screen but I did not want it to feel like a game.

# How it works

I find my code very messy as I did not want to waste any ideas I had in case I could reuse them for something else.
I ended up with 22 classes in total, including the ones that could be found in the project starter repository.
I tried to put as many functionalities inside seperates classes as possible, but I am not fully satisfied with the way I constructed the code.
For example the methods to read in the contents of the csv files, I created the methods inside the UI file, and I am pretty sure there was a better way of doing
it seperatelly.


# What I am most proud of in the assignment

The thing I am most proud of is the fact that I actually managed to present anything at all.
As I am not a Sci-Fi fun, I found the assignment especially difficulty because many times throughout developing the interface I just didn't know what to add there.
In everyday life I am a perfectionist in most of the things I do, and this project was no exemption. I learnt my lesson, as I know we do not always do what 
we like/are interested about.
